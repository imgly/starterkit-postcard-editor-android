The starter kit is built on top of the Creative Editor SDK. 
Built to facilitate optimal post- & greeting- card design, from changing accent colors and selecting fonts to custom messages and pictures
Toggling from edit to preview mode allows reviewing the design in the context of the entire post/greeting card.
A floating action button at the bottom of the editor features only the most essential editing options in order of relevance allowing users to overlay text, add images, shapes, stickers and upload new image assets.
